StackDeck is a web platform that helps developers search for companies based on their tech stack.

### Overview
##### What is StackDeck?
StackDeck is a platform that helps developers find companies based on their tech stack, compare different stacks and analyze popularity of different frameworks. The underlying dataset is scraped from the job listings available online and organised into a JSON.

You can use both the frontend and the API for browsing through the JSON dataset. The frontend search provides a grid of cards where each card represents a single company. Each card contains the company name, flavour text, the tech used by the company. You can navigate the page and click on any technology. The deck of cards will be shuffled to display only the companies that use the selected technology.



The frontend is purely for illustration purposes and has limited functionality.

Sample Request:
```python
import requests

company_name = "Monty Python"
url = f"https://stackdeck.dev/cards/?name={company_name}"

response = requests.get(url)
print(response.json())
```
Sample  Response:
```json
{
  "name": "Monty Python",
  "location": [
    "Camelot"
  ],
  "stack": [
    "Graham Chapman",
    "Holly Hand Grenade",
    "John Cleese"
  ],
  "flavor": "You've got two empty halves of coconuts and your bangin'em together.",
  "website": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python",
  "tags": [],
  "alt_link": "",
  "premium": false
}
```
